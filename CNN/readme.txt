%%%%instructions:
Task 1: MNISTfile.py
Mount the google drive first or change all the path varaibles to save the model
Task 1F and G : Task1F.py
Change the path of directories wherever stated

Task2: Task2.py
Run the google drive mount command if you saved the model in your drive or else remove the code and follow the below step
change the PATH1 and PATH2 variable to the location where you saved the model in the first file(MNISTfile.py)

Task3 :
Please categorize the greek symbol image folder into 3 sub folders for alpha, beta, gamma and save the images respectively
Similar to above change path of image directory and csv saving and loading directories if you are not loading with google drive
Change the number of epoch from 100 to 35 to save time

Task 4:
Task 4 doesnt involve any path location but every training command will take over 60 minutes as the number of iteration and data point is high


%%%% I have not tested any of these files in another IDE, as i had to test each command multiple times i preferred using google colab.
Thank You
